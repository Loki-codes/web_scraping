This was a fun project with many fun things to scrape. I am excited to get to revisit flask with a tutuor soon as that was the toughest part of this project. 

I have a few project ideas involving large amounts of complex scrapping and api calls so with that in mind I made this program as modular as possible and put each function into it's own file. 

If I were to do this as a recurring application instead of a one off homework I would add in the camand line requests in my table to html function so that it deletes the previous html data prior to creating and inserting the new html data.
